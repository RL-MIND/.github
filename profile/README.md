## üè´ RL-MIND Lab
RL-MIND Lab is a part of the R&L group at Nanjing University.
Our research focuses on brain-inspired artificial intelligence, efficient generative AI systems, and multimodal foundation models. 
The lab's current projects include brain-inspired learning mechanisms and large-scale intelligent systems. 

Members of RL-MIND Lab seek to bridge the gap between artificial and natural intelligence, contributing to the development of trustworthy and sustainable AI technologies.
We actively publish in top-tier venues such as CVPR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICCV.

## üîç Our Research Focus
- **Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence**: Leveraging  few-shot concept learning, continual learning, and brain-inspired cognitive computation models for efficient intelligence.
- **Efficient Generative AI System**: Adapting hardware-software codesign, model compression, and LLM quantization for robotic applications.
- **Multimodal Foundation Models**: Enabling the deployment and acceleration of large-scale models on edge devices.

## ü§ñ Open-Source Toolkits
We contribute to the community with practical and research-oriented toolkits:
- [**LibFewShot**](https://github.com/RL-VIG/LibFewShot): An open-source toolkit for  few-shot learning.
- [**LibContinual**](https://github.com/RL-VIG/LibContinual): An open-source continual learning toolbox.
